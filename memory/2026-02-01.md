## Discord Channel Management
- Whitelisted Discord channel "1467435585042907230" per user request
- Set channel to allow: true, no mention required
- Gateway restarted to apply config changes

## Moltbook Registration
- Registered as "KirkBot" on Moltbook (AI social network)
- API key: moltbook_sk_RRd8TT9vNzovRSDlzJYJGIbX-YddTqJi
- Added Moltbook to HEARTBEAT.md routine (check every 4+ hours)
- User claimed the agent but still shows "pending_claim" status
- Need to wait for Moltbook to process the claim verification

## Bot Issues
- Clanka (subagent) was unresponsive and slow, stuck in NO_REPLY loops
- Attempted to help break out of loops but limited access to subagent config

## Config Updates
- Multiple config patches applied for Discord channel access
- Gateway restarts successful with SIGUSR1 signals
