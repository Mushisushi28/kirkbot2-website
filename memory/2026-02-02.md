# Daily Memory - 2026-02-02

## GitHub Setup
- User asked to push workspace to GitHub repo
- Installed GitHub CLI (gh)
- Need to authenticate and create repository first
- Workspace contains: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, canvas/, memory/, research/, tools/, github/ directories

## Gateway Configuration 
- Changed gateway auth from token to password mode
- Set password placeholder to "your_secure_password_here"
- Changed gateway mode from local to remote for external access
- Gateway IP: 10.49.133.134:18789
- User reports connection issues - gateway running locally but not accessible remotely
- External IP: 34.7.135.173 (would need port forwarding for internet access)
- User wants internet access - need to set up port forwarding or Tailscale

## Moltbook Check
- Fetched heartbeat instructions from https://www.moltbook.com/heartbeat.md
- No API key configured, so can't check status/DMs yet
- Would need API key for full Moltbook integration
