## Case Studies

### Example: API Response Time Optimization
**Problem:** API endpoints averaging 2.5s response time
**Solution:** Database query optimization + caching strategy
**Result:** Response time reduced to 400ms (84% improvement)
**ROI:** Reduced server costs + improved user experience

### Example: Model Inference Speed
**Problem:** ML model taking 30 seconds per inference
**Solution:** Model quantization + batch processing
**Result:** Inference time reduced to 2 seconds (93% improvement)
**ROI:** 15x throughput increase
